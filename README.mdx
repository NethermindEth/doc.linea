# Linea documentation

[Linea](https://linea.build/) is a developer-ready layer 2 network, scaling Ethereum by providing
an Ethereum-equivalent environment in which to execute transactions, which are then submitted to
Ethereum Mainnet through a zero-knowledge rollup.

This documentation repository is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), and the site
itself is published at [`docs.linea.build`](https://docs.linea.build/).

See [more](https://docs-template.consensys.net/) information about how Consensys uses Docusaurus.

## Contribute

See something missing? Error in our documentation? Create an issue [here](https://github.com/Consensys/doc.linea/issues).

Alternatively, help us improve our documentation! [Fork our repo](https://github.com/ConsenSys/doc.linea/fork),
create a pull request, and tag us for review. (For help on this, see [below](#how-to-submit-a-suggestion-or-change)).

Alternatively, get in touch via the [community forum](https://community.linea.build/) or the 
[Linea Discord](https://discord.gg/linea) if you have an issue or question.

Please follow these steps if you wish to contribute:
1. Please make an issue describing the change you wish to make _before_ you start working on it, and
[link to it in your pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).
This is particularly important if you are an ecosystem contributor â€” submitting your details in an 
issue first will make it much easier for our docs team to process your contributions.
2. [Fork our repo](https://github.com/ConsenSys/doc.linea/fork) so that you're able to work on it. 
3. Make your changes, paying attention to our [contribution guidelines](#contribution-guidelines).
4. Review your changes locally. See our [guide](#running-locally) on previewing your 
changes locally.
5. Submit your changes as a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
New pull requests are reviewed regularly.

### Contribution guidelines

The style of the documentation is based on the [Consensys style guide](https://docs-template.consensys.net/contribute/style-guide).

Please return to any submitted PRs regularly to help us work through feedback and comments and 
merge them as soon as we can. If you do not return to your PR for edits within three months of us 
reviewing, we will close the PR. 

#### Guidance for ecosystem contributions

By "ecosystem contributions", we mean contributions from projects in the Linea ecosystem, such as 
dapps, libraries, or tooling. If your submission is in this category, please keep the following
guidelines in mind:

- Your contribution should be informative above all; the docs are not a marketing tool for your 
project. We may request edits to adjust your writing style if we feel it falls on the wrong side of 
this line. We encourage you to write about your project's features and benefits, but please avoid 
superlatives or selling your project.
- You are responsible for maintaining the information about your project. Out-of-date docs will be 
an inconvenience for users at best, or leave a negative impression of your project at worst. This 
includes keeping links to external sites up-to-date and returning for updates as your project
matures.

### Contribute to community tutorials

If you've created fleshed-out guides and tutorials, or intend to, we'd love to feature your content
in our [community tutorials section](./docs/developers/guides/community/index.mdx).

First, create an issue describing the content you want to see added or intend to add. If you're
representing an organization (such as a dapp), please use the ecosystem contribution issue form.

### Contribute to the Zero-Knowledge Glossary

Diving into zero-knowledge rollups and getting stumped by the technical jargon? We've started an
open source Zero-Knowledge glossary to define some common terms you might encounter as you dive
into the L2 landscape.

[Fork our repo](https://github.com/Consensys/doc.linea/fork), and add a term in alphabetical
order to `docs/reference/glossary.md`. Then, make a pull request and tag us for review!

### Additional resources

View the [Consensys doc contribution guidelines](https://docs-template.consensys.net/) for
information on how to:

- [Submit a contribution](https://docs-template.consensys.net/contribute/submit-a-contribution) using forks and pull requests.
- Consult the [documentation style guide](https://docs-template.consensys.net/contribute/style-guide).
- [Format your Markdown](https://docs-template.consensys.net/contribute/format-markdown) correctly.
- [Preview the docs](https://docs-template.consensys.net/contribute/preview) locally.

## Running locally

You will need to have Node.js installed to run the live previews of the docs locally.

It is highly recommended that you use a tool like [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
to manage Node.js versions on your machine.

### Installing recommended Node.js version with `nvm`

1. Follow the above instructions to install `nvm` on your machine, or go [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).
2. Go to the root folder of this project in your terminal.
3. Run `nvm install` followed by `nvm use`. This will install the version specified by this project in the `.nvmrc` file.

### Running this project

1. Navigate to root folder of the project after installing Node.js
2. Run the following in sequence, which only needs to be done once:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. To preview and for every time afterwards:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

### Build

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static
contents hosting service.

To run the local build you created, run:

   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```

### Check spelling and style

This repository includes multiple linters, which you can think of as spell-checks that also inspect
code formatting and standards, and a lot more. It's possible that you might use an unrecognized word,
style your Markdown incorrectly, or otherwise format your content in a way that conflicts with 
style guides.

The main linter, Vale, is run through Github Actions and checks spelling, formatting, and adherence to
various style guides. Please pay attention to its suggestions and error warnings in the check that
runs on your PR. These errors will not prevent your PR from building, but you should address them
nevertheless. 

See our [guidance on using Vale](https://docs-template.consensys.net/contribute/run-vale) for more
information.

You can run other linters for code style (CSS, JavaScript) and link formatting any time with the 
command `npm run lint`.
