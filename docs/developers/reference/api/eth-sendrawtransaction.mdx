# `eth_sendRawTransaction`

:::note

`eth_sendRawTransaction` is functionally very similar to the [Ethereum Mainnet equivalent](https://docs.infura.io/api/networks/ethereum/json-rpc-methods/eth_sendrawtransaction). 

The difference lies in the [error responses](#errors). On Linea, `eth_sendRawTransaction` has some 
unique error responses.

:::

Submits a pre-signed and serialized transaction and returns the transaction hash if successful. 
This endpoint can help prevent transactions being rejected due to exceeding the sequencer's 
per-block line limit. If the line count check fails, it returns an error message indicating the 
transaction is likely to be rejected.

:::info

Please note the error relating to exceeding the line limit is only available on Besu nodes using 
version `delivery-25` or later, together with `linea-sequencer` v0.1.4-test28 or later.

:::

On Linea, each transaction is represented by a sequence of lines representing the operations 
happening at the EVM level. These lines are grouped by modules and are used as inputs to the prover. 
In order to limit the resources required to generate proofs, limits are enforced on the maximum 
number of lines each module can have. Hence, when a transaction is considered for inclusion in a 
block, a [line count check is performed to ensure it conforms to the requirements](../../../architecture/stack/trace-expansion-proving/prover-limits.mdx).

## Parameters

`transaction data`: [Required] The signed transaction data.

## Returns

The 32-byte transaction hash, or the zero hash if the transaction is not yet available.

## Errors

### Gas price too low

The error `Gas price too low` is thrown when the transaction's gas is too low; specifically, the 
offered gas doesn't create enough of a buffer to ensure that Linea can cover the costs of 
finalizing the transaction on L1.

### Transaction line count above limit

This error will display in the format:
`Transaction line count for module [A] is above the limit [B]`

Where `[A]`  is the module for which the number of lines is above the maximum allowed value `[B]`,
with `[B]` a parameter of the system.
